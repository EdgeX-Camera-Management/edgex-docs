# Support Notifications - Purpose

![image](EdgeX_SupportingServicesAlertsNotifications.png)

When another system or a person needs to know that something occurred in EdgeX, the
alerts and notifications microservice sends that notification.
Examples of alerts and notifications that other services could broadcast include the provisioning of a new device, abnormal sensor data detected
(usually detected by a device service or rules engine), or system or service
malfunctions (usually detected by system management services).
